##Final Project: Final Fantasy XIV Character Creator

The inspiration for my project had been after we had done the D&D lab towards the beginning of the semester.
I had a lot of fun with that lab in particular, and so I decided it would be a fun project to make something similar
based off of a game that I've been playing and enjoying for quite some time now, FFXIV. Although it is very rudimentary
my project involves a character creation option, an option to display some premade characters from the video game,
the option to battle one of those characters, and an informational page for the game, alongside a button to exit the program.
Working on this project had probably been the most fun, albeit still stressful, project for me all semester as it tied to something
I enjoy so deeply which never really made it feel obligatory in any way; simply something I chipped away at until I reached my final product.

These wireframe diagrams and the GIF display the main menu as well as each of the other menus corresponding to which button the user presses

1) Starting from the top left, that first option allows the user to create a character with a number of different customization options
2) The top right option will display the "Scions" which are a list of preset character that are a part of Final Fantasy XIV
3) The bottom left option will bring you to a battle menu where two predetermined characters will be able to battle using a set of options
4) The bottom right option will bring up a brief informational page that has a link for the user to navigate to should they desire it
